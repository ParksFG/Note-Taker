## Description

This project was a test of the many things express.js has to offer.  Working with multiple http requests, data persistence, modular routing, middleware, and testing with the program Insomnia.  It wasn't an easy test, but that's why it's a test.  I feel like I learned a lot, despite banging my head over and over trying to figure out why a function wasn't saving the updated array.  However, it still was a fun project and look forward to exploring more of express.js.
